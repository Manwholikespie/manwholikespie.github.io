Greetings und achtung, my dear children.  

I am Robert Dominguez: a CS student who enjoys toying around with webscraping and statistical learning.  

BeautifulSoup, requests, and selenium are my current specialties, however I am also quite competant at Flask, scikit-learn, and pandas. I am currently working to improve my skills in database languages such as Postgres and MongoDB, and my understanding of machine learning using keras.
